# Subscriptions-CLI

This is a simple command line utility for subscribing to telemetry events from the [capsule8 sensor](https://github.com/capsule8/capsule8/)

The telemtry cli takes one argument: a path to a subscription file. Subscriptions are a high level object used by clients to the telemetry service
in the sensor for receiving telemetry events. These files are simply subscription structs marshalled to JSON. The subscriptions directory
contains a few examples. Also check out the [doc for getting telemetry](../../docs/Getting-Telemetry.md) for an in-depth view of how this works.

If you write a subscription file that you think others would find useful, feel free to contribute it!

# Quickstart

1) [Build and run the capsule8 sensor](../../README.md#Quickstart)

2) Build this example tool by running `make`

3) Run the tool by passing a JSON subscription file located in [subscriptions](./subscriptions) (*You will need to run this as root*)

```
$ sudo ./c8cli subscriptions/ContainerEvents.json
